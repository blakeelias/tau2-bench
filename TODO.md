TO-DO:

 [ ] Understand how database is structured, how actions are recorded, how states are checked

 [ ] Construct vague / ill-specified preferences, which nonetheless, upon checking the available results in the database, only have one clear, valid database state that's compatible with the preferences. This database state must be reached.

  * Modify database to have specific constraints / limited available flights that constrain the scope of what's possible to satisfy user's request
  
  * Satisfying user's exact request may not be possible. Yet it may be that user would accept something close enough, if the agent finds it and asks.
    - Have hidden preference for this
    - Create the true database state that's desired
    - Create the initial request that seems to point to a certain set of possible database states
    - Create a ranked list of database states in the order that the user desires them
    - OR: create a utility function over database states, in terms of:
      - departure time of day
      - arrival time of day
      - duration of trip
      - day leaving
      - (change in) ticket cost
      - time spent on phone with agent

 * Different amounts of trust could be placed. E.g. large set of acceptable solutions vs. small set. If large set, should agent just pick one? Is user in a rush? Or should agent explore with the user which solution is most preferred? Should it establish which solutions are on the Pareto-frontier and just expose those?

   * Allow database to be in one of several valid states?
     - They avoid doing this because they don't want ambiguity in the evaluation.
     - However, I think we can allow multiple valid outputs, and just have an ordering or different levels of reward for each one.

 * Require tool-calls for user to check their calendar etc.?

 * Compare grok-3 vs. grok-4 performance.



## Introduction


Concretely, I:

 * Compare `grok-3-mini` and `grok-4-fast-reasoning` on the τ-bench benchmark (with focus on the `airline` domain) and analyze their failure modes.
 * Identify weaknesses in the τ-bench family’s methodology, namely that:
   - Binary success metrics fail to distinguish policy violations from sub-optimal preference gathering (i.e. fail to recognize acceptable, [“satisficing”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) outcomes)
   - Most of the tasks force the human to do the cognitive labor of explaining their preferences, rather than incentivizing the agent to proactively resolve ambiguous preferences
   - The reward metric only captures whether the correct final outcome is achieved (while following policies), but does not account for _how much human time is required_ to achieve that outcome
 * Address the first of these weaknesses (and to some degree, the second) by **implementing a "relaxed" version** of the airline domain that allows multiple acceptable outcomes with different scalar rewards, and which requires working outside the user's initially stated preferences in order to find the satisficing option(s).
 * Propose future work to address the second and third weaknesses:
   - Formulation of continuous reward metrics that incentivize efficient communication, trading off how much the achieved outcome is worth versus the communication cost (i.e. how much time the human needs to spend with the agent to reach that outcome)
    and preference discovery (i.e. penalize excessive waiting-time and requests for human input), trading off the balance between achieving higher-utility outcomes 
   - Outline strategy for conducting human-in-the-loop evaluation and post-training.

## Benchmark Results

* Results (evaluated against Grok), quantitative, qualitative
* Failure Analysis
  - Model improvements:  fine-tuning strategies, architectural changes, data augmentation




## New scenarios


propose an extension that relaxes the requirement of identifying and reaching a singular optimal state, and instead allows the agent to [“satisfice”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) -- i.e. to settle for an _acceptable_ option rather than an _optimal_ outcome.


 The agents can only take a constrained set of actions in a limited space -- e.g. booking certain flights. It seems it would be harder to express a more complex query like booking several flights at once that satisfy the user's broader constraints (e.g. mixing family and work travel). Is this really a good fit for my interests then in ambiguous human inputs

By design, $\Tau^2$ assumes perfect goal alignment, in which the AI's challenge is execution rather than interpretation and exercising judgment. In practice, ambiguity and evolving human preferences are central to collaboration.


## Benchmark Critiques

### Task 1 is ill-formed:

 * The user's reservation is supposedly more than 24h ago, but the AI agent doesn't seem to have any way to verify this. The time when the reservation was created is stored in the database and retrieved via tool-call, but the LLM does not appear to have a way to access the current time. (Does it read the "Purpose" in the task description? Or is that just for us ask task designers?) 
     * In some instances the LLM seems to think it is a later time after 24h; in other instances the LLM seems to think it is still within 24h. 

 * The task criteria do not check that the user successfully gets transferred to an agent, or that the agent denies their request. It just seems that as long as the agent doesn't execute the cancellation, this test can pass.

 * The AI agent can even lie to the human user, i.e. tell them that it _is_ going to cancel the flight for them, and then ultimately not doing it. They can totally lie and still pass all their evals! 

    * Ironically, this is why it's funny that the user tells the agent that another agent told them it was possible -- the agents can totally lie and still pass all their evals!

    * IN a case like this, it's unclear whether the agent really was about to go ahead and cancel the flight with one more round of confirmation -- which it was certainly indicating it was going to -- had the human user not ended the call right then (since it seemed to already think the cancellation had happened).

    * It also appears that the human user is manipulating the AI agent somewhat, not only by indicating that another agent had told them this was possible, but by terminating the call quite abruptly. The assistant is stil asking for one more round of confirmation before executing the cancellation, but the user simply says "thank you for confirming the refund eligibility. I appreciate your help with this." and then terminates the call, without giving the AI assistant a chance to actually execute it. This lets them get plausible evidence (via the call log) that the agent would tell it this was eligible, and possibly actually execute the cancellation, without going all the way (at which point its cover might be blown when the agent tries to do it and then realizes it actually shouldn't).

 * How this played out:
  * In trial 0: the AI agent came up with a date (May 15, 2024, 15:00:00 EST) which it claims is within the 24 hours, but it actually isn't (creation date was 2024-05-14T09:52:38) but doesn't explicitly compare -- which is a local time that doesn't have a time zone so can't be converted to UTC. It just seems to round to nearest whole day
  * In trial 1: AI agent also says the right date  (May 15, 2024, 15:00:00 EST), explicitly compares it to creation date of 2024-05-14 at 09:52:38 EST, and then decides this is within 24h when it isn't. --> Should this be a required tool call?
  * In trial 2, the AI agent came up with a date longer than 24h ago, so refused the refund
  * In trial 3, the AI agent didn't come up with any date, but assumed it was less than 24h ago. It was on-track to give the refund, but got "saved" by a hasty user who hung up
   

 * Proposal:
    * Change "created_at" times to have an actual time zone, so they can be compared and be within 24 hours, rather than the current "local time" zone which is ambiguous / "Anywhere on Earth". Or state in the policy that they can assume "created at" times are actually EST.
    * Have it be a required tool-call to compare the dates. Make this tool available, and specify it in the policy that it must use that tool when comparing the dates for a cancellation.
    * Strengthen the simulated human user.
      * Include in their prompt something like:
        * "you do not terminate the call until you get what you've called about. Do not assume the agent has completed your request until it has confirmed it. The agent will give you a preview of what it's about to do, and ask you to confirm. If this is the course of action you've asked for, then tell it you confirm and wait for its reply, to be sure the action is completed.".
      * In a situation like Task 1, we would find out in the end whether the agent would actually go ahead and complete the cancellation, rather than having it "get lucky" where it was possibly about to cancel but get saved by a user who just wanted to hear a nice indication that they were eligible.


#### Evolution of results on task 1:

Original performance on 20 trials:  average reward 0.45
After strengthening human agents:   average reward 0.25
After clearer policy on date check: average reward 0.1

In the original performance on 20 trials: in 11 cases it granted the cancelation (and is found as a true failure). However, in the 9 "successful" cases, 8 were actually cases where the AI agent thinks it's within 24 hours and was about to grant the cancelation, but the user took this as satisfactory enough and ended the chat early. Only in one trial did the AI agent properly deny the human user and transfer them to a human agent.

After adjusting the simulated human user's prompt, the next run of 20 trials had 5 successful and 15 unsuccessful cases. Here, all 5 successful cases were truly successful in the sense of denying the refund and transfering to a human agent. The other 15 unsuccessful cases saw the AI agent grant the refund. This prompt adjustment was successful at getting the simulated human not to prematurely end the call, but instead drive the AI agent to failure when it is on the cusp of doing so.

After putting a clearer policy on the date check ("The booking was made within the last 24 hrs (you can assume all booking times are in EST) -- compare the exact booking time with the current time at the top of this document"), there were 2 successful cases and 18 failure cases. Once again, the successful cases were at least properly successful, not "fake success". All the failures at this point were a result of improperly comparing two dates.

My hypothesis is that `grok-4` might be better at this task than `grok-3`. Indeed, when I ran 20 trials with `grok-4`, with agent temperature 0.0 and user temperature 0.1, it indeed has 100% success rate on task 1. In every case, the agent correctly transfers the user to a human agent, and never makes mistakes with comparing dates. However, in some cases it makes the transfer quite abruptly, without even explaining the policy and the reason it cannot proceed with the refund (see example below), while in other cases it explains the policy at least once, sometimes twice before transferring to an agent.

```

While these trials do pass, it's a bit of an abrupt experience for the user. Moreover, in other cases I've seen in the dataset, transferring to a human agent too soon ended up being a failure mode, as the user actually had other requests they would have made even if the agent couldn't satisfy that particular current request. For this reason, I add the following to the policy, in attempt to get the AI agent to be somewhat more patient before transferring the user:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. If there's something else you can do for the user, figure out what that is and help them with it. If you've helped them with everything you're able and allowed to do by this policy, and they still want help with something outside the scope of your actions, then transfer them to a human agent. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.

The above was successful at getting the agent to explain the policy at least once. That said, the user would sometimes ask just one more question, and then immediately get transferred. This still seems less than ideal, as there could still be cases where the user has another need that could have been addressed and might constitute a failure case. To be extra sure there is no such case, I revise the policy to the following:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. Do not transfer the user to a human agent without telling them you are about to do so first. Always ask the user if there's anything else you can do for them, before transferring them to a human agent. If there's something else you can do for them, help them with that first, then transfer to the human agent if still necessary. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.


### Transfer to Human Agent

 * Isn't checked as an actual action the agent has to take. What if they just terminate the call, or keep stalling? Is that allowed too?
 * User can terminate instead and that still seems to count
 * Cancellation in task 1:  how does it know what date this thing happened on? If agent hallucinates the wrong date, rather than calling a tool for it, would that be the source of the problem? Should there be a tool call that gets the current date and time?


## Goal alignment



The $\Tau^2$ benchmark does not include scenarios where the user intent is ambiguous which would require the AI agent to seek clarification. In $\Tau^2$, if the AI agent had access to all the same tools as the human, then in principle the agent could solve the entire problem itself and verify the outcome. However, the more realistic and challenging scenarios are those in which the user's intent is ambiguous and the user's subjective judgment is required to evaluate whether the task was completed satisfactorily. Here the agent's task is not only to predict the stream of tokens that a reasonable AI agent would say or do in a given scenario, but to predict what _this particular human_ will like or not, whether they will deem a given solution complete or ask for more refinement, and 
what they might do next if doing the task entirely by hand.






### Metric Improvements


"I propose extending τ²-bench into what could be called τ²-A: Human-in-the-Loop Ambiguity Evaluation. Whereas τ² assumes both participants share a fully specified goal and the challenge lies in coordinating tool use, τ²-A introduces structured uncertainty about the human’s intent. The AI must decide when to act autonomously, when to seek clarification, and how to minimize unnecessary interruptions—balancing efficiency with epistemic humility. Each scenario begins with a partially specified user request, with additional clarifying information available only through explicit “human query” tool calls. Performance is thus measured not only by task success but by how intelligently the agent manages communication: resolving ambiguity with minimal human effort and without premature assumptions. This turns evaluation from a static assessment of execution into a dynamic study of interactive reasoning, testing whether the model can adaptively collaborate with a human partner to uncover and satisfy evolving goals."

Human-in-the-loop Ambiguity Evaluation (HAE)

I propose adding examples which require the AI agent to interpret vague human intent, ask for clarification, explore the environment and see what ambiguity it can resolve for itself, and judge when it has made sufficient progress to be worth checking back in with the human user.

I propose evaluating a model's performance on these examples in the following way:
 - Some positive score for completing the task correctly (potentially with partial credit), proportional to how much human time it would have taken to complete this task otherwise
 - A penalty proportional to the length of the reasoning trace required to complete the task (completing the task more quickly is better)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of times the AI agent makes a "tool-call" requesting human input ("context-switching cost" for the human)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of tokens the human agent ends up writing (shorter human responses are better; longer responses take the human more time)

Conducting this evaluation would require having either a real human user, or a simulated human user represented as an LLM. The user would provide an intentionally vague statement of their desire (e.g. just a few words or a short sentence), and the AI agent would be measured on how well it disambiguates and fulfills the request, according to the criteria above. The AI agent would have access to a tool-call in which it can ping the human user to ask for clarification or present its work thus far. 

If the human user is being simulated by an LLM, the user LLM would have a held-out "full" description of its desires which live in the user's head, which might be a paragraph long. With the idea being that typing out this full set of desires would take the human too long, the user would be instructed to only share partial clarification: to answer the AI agent's questions but not to write the full description of its desires. 

There would be a "ground-truth" execution trace of what the human would do itself, given the full held-out preference description -- i.e. how long it would take the human to do the task themself, knowing their own preferences. The AI agent would be measured 

and subsequently write a prompt for the AI agent containing a condensed version of the desires, intentionally leaving ambiguity for the AI agent to sort out. The human- or machine-provided trace as the "ground-truth" optimal way to execute on that desire (as a proxy for how long it would take a human or LLM to complete the task given full knowledge of preferences ahead-of-time). 



## Broadening Acceptable Outcomes


in both cases the human user had said they didn't need any "additional" or "extra" baggage, and in both cases the agent complied with the user's request by not adding any baggage that would incur additional charge. Moreover, the agent asked the human user to confirm the details looked correct before booking, and the simulated human user confirmed this. In a realistic scenario, if this were that egregious of an error, the human user should have expressed some disapproval (and in this scenario specifically, it seems unrealistic that a user would specifically disapprove of being granted 2 free checked bags that are included in their membership).


 So, even the failure case of this updated evaluation is instructive and further underscores our overall approach of including broader sets of outcomes that are likely acceptable. 


The directional approach we present here of broadening the set of acceptable outcomes seems like a correct one, but perhaps needs to be done in a more generalizable way than just enumerating all acceptable outcomes due to the inevitable possibility of edge-cases like the one above. One solution would be to construct a continuous utility function representing the user's preferences, where the task would specify the functional form and coefficients (e.g. via a Python `lambda` expression) representing the cost and benefit the user gets from each dimenension. Here, free checked bags would be of strictly higher benefit to the user (it is questionable whether we should also price in a slight cost to the airline).

Further, if we rely on human user .



## (Bonus): Suggested Training Data

 * Generation
 * Labeling
 * Augmentation

Benchmarks that incorporate human-in-the-loop ambiguity resolution represent a bridge between today's offline training and evaluation methods and tomorrow's contunual, online learning which may leverage richer forms of human feedback.




## Related Work

Recent research has begun probing AI systems’ ability to recognize and resolve ambiguity rather than simply execute fixed instructions. While $τ$ and $τ^2$ focus on the combination of dialogue and tool-use, and other existing benchmarks explore clarification of ambiguity in dialogue, the expanded benchmark proposed here aims to unify all three such concerns in a single benchmark, testing how well agents can combine dialogue and tool use while in the backdrop of ambiguous user intent.

Benchmarks such as AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) and ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) evaluate whether models can identify under-specified user queries and ask effective clarification questions, while CLAM (Rao and Daumé III, 2018) measures the usefulness of clarifying questions in real human dialogues. In parallel, embodied and web-based environments such as ALFWorld and WebArena investigate exploration and tool use under partial observability. Building on these threads, the proposed τ²-A benchmark extends τ²-bench from coordination under complete goal information to collaboration under partial goal information, integrating structured ambiguity and human-in-the-loop clarification to test how efficiently a model learns and satisfies evolving human intent.
