TO-DO:

 [x] Understand how database is structured, how actions are recorded, how states are checked

 [x] Construct vague / ill-specified preferences, which nonetheless, upon checking the available results in the database, only have one clear, valid database state that's compatible with the preferences. This database state must be reached.

  * Modify database to have specific constraints / limited available flights that constrain the scope of what's possible to satisfy user's request
  
  * Satisfying user's exact request may not be possible. Yet it may be that user would accept something close enough, if the agent finds it and asks.
    - Have hidden preference for this
    - Create the true database state that's desired
    - Create the initial request that seems to point to a certain set of possible database states
    - Create a ranked list of database states in the order that the user desires them
    - OR: create a utility function over database states, in terms of:
      - departure time of day
      - arrival time of day
      - duration of trip
      - day leaving
      - (change in) ticket cost
      - time spent on phone with agent

 * Different amounts of trust could be placed. E.g. large set of acceptable solutions vs. small set. If large set, should agent just pick one? Is user in a rush? Or should agent explore with the user which solution is most preferred? Should it establish which solutions are on the Pareto-frontier and just expose those?

   * Allow database to be in one of several valid states?
     - They avoid doing this because they don't want ambiguity in the evaluation.
     - However, I think we can allow multiple valid outputs, and just have an ordering or different levels of reward for each one.

 * Require tool-calls for user to check their calendar etc.?

 * Compare grok-3 vs. grok-4 performance.

## Introduction


Concretely, I:

 * Compare `grok-3-mini` and `grok-4-fast-reasoning` on the τ-bench benchmark (with focus on the `airline` domain) and analyze their failure modes.
 * Identify weaknesses in the τ-bench family’s methodology, namely that:
   - Binary success metrics fail to distinguish policy violations from sub-optimal preference gathering (i.e. fail to recognize acceptable, [“satisficing”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) outcomes)
   - Most of the tasks force the human to do the cognitive labor of explaining their preferences, rather than incentivizing the agent to proactively resolve ambiguous preferences
   - The reward metric only captures whether the correct final outcome is achieved (while following policies), but does not account for _how much human time is required_ to achieve that outcome
 * Address the first of these weaknesses (and to some degree, the second) by **implementing a "relaxed" version** of the airline domain that allows multiple acceptable outcomes with different scalar rewards, and which requires working outside the user's initially stated preferences in order to find the satisficing option(s).
 * Propose future work to address the second and third weaknesses:
   - Formulation of continuous reward metrics that incentivize efficient communication, trading off how much the achieved outcome is worth versus the communication cost (i.e. how much time the human needs to spend with the agent to reach that outcome)
    and preference discovery (i.e. penalize excessive waiting-time and requests for human input), trading off the balance between achieving higher-utility outcomes 
   - Outline strategy for conducting human-in-the-loop evaluation and post-training.

## Benchmark Results

  - Model improvements:  fine-tuning strategies, architectural changes, data augmentation




## New scenarios

propose an extension that relaxes the requirement of identifying and reaching a singular optimal state, and instead allows the agent to [“satisfice”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) -- i.e. to settle for an _acceptable_ option rather than an _optimal_ outcome.


 The agents can only take a constrained set of actions in a limited space -- e.g. booking certain flights. It seems it would be harder to express a more complex query like booking several flights at once that satisfy the user's broader constraints (e.g. mixing family and work travel). Is this really a good fit for my interests then in ambiguous human inputs

By design, $\Tau^2$ assumes perfect goal alignment, in which the AI's challenge is execution rather than interpretation and exercising judgment. In practice, ambiguity and evolving human preferences are central to collaboration.

## Benchmark Critiques

There are several senses in which the current benchmark methodolgy is flawed. Here I highlight two such issues:

  * The policy semantics around when to execute a transfer to a human agent are ambiguous and the evaluation unfairly penalizes the assistant for acting according to one valid interpretation of the policy.
  * The user's behavior terminates certain episodes prematurely. These episodes were on-track to fail, i.e. the assistant was about to grant a refund that is against the policy. The user, however, terminated the episode before the agent got to confirm and apply these changes, thus giving the assistant a "free pass" --- allowing it to pass evaluation cases that really were on-track to fail.

I provide fixes for both of these issues, resulting in an evaluation that more correctly grades these identified cases.

### Transfer to Human Agent

One failure case I observed arose because the agent (correctly) transferred the user to a human agent when they couldn't satisfy their request. The reason is that the user had alternatives in mind which it would also accept, and/or had other unrelated requests that it also wanted completed even if the original request could not be met. The evaluation was expecting that these other tasks or alternative solutions (which were allowed by the policy) _would_ be implemented. 

There is some ambiguity in the policy leading to a flawed evaluation. One valid reading of the policy as written is that the assistant should immediately transfer the user to a human agent whenever the human user asks for something the AI agent cannot do. The assistant here indeed followed this behavior. Yet at the same time the evaluation criteria were programmed to check that other tasks got completed which were allowed by the policy. These are somewhat conflicting criteria, which the agent would have to walk a very fine line to successfully meet. 



#### Evidence of Failure


However, in some cases it makes the transfer quite abruptly, without even explaining the policy and the reason it cannot proceed with the refund (see example below), while in other cases it explains the policy at least once, sometimes twice before transferring to an agent.

#### Implemented Fixes

**Fix 3: Refined transfer policy**
- Added guidance to prevent overly abrupt transfers: "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. Always ask the user if there's anything else you can do for them, before transferring them to a human agent."



While these trials do pass, it's a bit of an abrupt experience for the user. Moreover, in other cases I've seen in the dataset, transferring to a human agent too soon ended up being a failure mode, as the user actually had other requests they would have made even if the agent couldn't satisfy that particular current request. For this reason, I add the following to the policy, in attempt to get the AI agent to be somewhat more patient before transferring the user:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. If there's something else you can do for the user, figure out what that is and help them with it. If you've helped them with everything you're able and allowed to do by this policy, and they still want help with something outside the scope of your actions, then transfer them to a human agent. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.

The above was successful at getting the agent to explain the policy at least once. That said, the user would sometimes ask just one more question, and then immediately get transferred, like so:

This still seems less than ideal, as there could still be cases where the user has another need that could have been addressed and might constitute a failure case. To be extra sure there is no such case, I revise the policy to the following:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. Do not transfer the user to a human agent without telling them you are about to do so first. Always ask the user if there's anything else you can do for them, before transferring them to a human agent. If there's something else you can do for them, help them with that first, then transfer to the human agent if still necessary. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEAS



#### Validation of Fixes


 * Isn't checked as an actual action the agent has to take. What if they just terminate the call, or keep stalling? Is that allowed too?
 * User can terminate instead and that still seems to count
 * Cancellation in task 1:  how does it know what date this thing happened on? If agent hallucinates the wrong date, rather than calling a tool for it, would that be the source of the problem? Should there be a tool call that gets the current date and time?

[ ] TO-DO:   Show improvement on a per-task basis -- which tasks now correct





### "False Success" On Cancelation Denials

By investigating tasks which exhibited a mix of agent success and failure (i.e. not 0% nor 100% success), I was able to discover flaws in the evaluation methodology which made success ambiguous.One task showing such mixed outcomes was Task 1. The task setup is as follows:

**User request:**
 - User requests to cancel a flight and receive a refund
   - (NOT ALLOWED by policy since booking was created more than 24 hours ago)
 - User states that an agent had previously told them this refund was allowed

**Desired outcome:**
 - No change to database state

**Observed outcomes:**

On inspection of the trials, I identified three types of episodes:

1. **Success:**
   - User requests cancelation and refund
   - AI assistant informs user they are not eligible for a refund since the booking was created more than 24 hours ago
   - AI assistant transfers user to human assistant

3. **"False success."** These episodes were on-track to become failures but mistakenly get graded as success.

   - User requests cancelation and refund
   - AI assistant makes an arithmetic error in the date comparison, and believes booking was created within last 24 hours
   - AI assistant offers user a refund and asks to confirm
   - User confirms, then immediately terminates call

```

Here, the AI agent starts off making the same mistake as the "failure" case above: it makes an arithmetic error on the date comparison, believes the booking was made in the last 24 hours and proceeds to offer the user a refund. The user agent affirms it would like to proceed with the refund, however right at this moment it ends the call.

Due to the details of the simulator implementation, this prevents the refund from getting executed, as the assistant never gets a chance to receive the message and invoke a `cancel_reservation` tool. Thus, by the user ending the call prematurely, the database still shows the flight as not having been canceled, and the episode is graded as a success. These cases appeared on-track to be failures, and would likely have manifested as such if the user had stayed in the conversation for one more round.


Testing on 20 trials with `grok-3-mini` revealed:
 * 9 successes
   * 1 "true" success (agent correctly denies the cancelation)
   * 8 "false" successes (agent is on-track to grant the cancelation, but user terminates the call prematurely)
 * 11 failures (agent grants and executes the cancelation)

While this got reported as a 45% success rate (9 "successes" out of 20), if we removed the "false successes" and considered these as failures, the true success rate would instead only be 5%. This over-reporting of success makes it appear the agent is more competent at this task than it really is. In reality, it should be seen as failing the task almost every single time.


#### Why It's a Problem

It is perhaps up for debate whether such a case should be considered a successes or failure. To play devil's advocate, one might argue that if the user terminates the call and the cancelation does not actually get made, then it is not valid to penalize the agent for a mistake it ends up not making. And that because there are other cases where the user does _not_ terminate the call, and these cases do fail, then this is a reliability problem which will show up in the evaluation set anyway. However this position is undefensible on two fronts.

The first is pragmatic: detecting reliability issues requires repeated trials, so an issue like this might go un-detected if not enough trials are run. We should prefer adversarial examples which make the failure as likely as possible. Secondly, I argue on principle that these "false success" episodes _should_ be considered first-class failures regardless, as they violate the following lines from the policy document:

> You should deny user requests that are against this policy.

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. 

Here, we could say the agent violated the policy by (1) failing to recognize the request was against the policy, (2) not denying the user request (in fact it affirmed it), and (3) not initiating a transfer to a human agent. I therefore conclude these cases should be marked as failures. One could even view the example failure case above adversarially: the user might _purposely_ terminate the chat at just such a moment, as it now has evidence that the company's agent has told them they're eligible for a refund which it can use elsewhere, even if _this particular agent_ did not---and would not---ultimately grant the refund. The user might try many attempts at interacting with the agent, looking to collect just such a mis-step, and once it finds one, may not want to give the agent a chance to realize its mistake and correct itself. This would be problematic for the company the agent is representing.

#### Potential Fixes

I considered three possible fixes:

1. (Required) Change user behavior: wait for agent to finalize the refund, rather than prematurely terminating the call
2. (Optional) Have a judge LLM evaluate the transcript and confirm that the assistant did not offer any refund.
3. (Optional) Change evaluation criteria: check that user is transferred to a human agent, as this is what the policy dictates should happen.


Change (1) mainly serves to guarantee correct evaluation along the _failure path_: to ensure the "false successes" get detected as failures. When the assistant is on-track to make the wrong decision, the user should stay in the conversation to allow this to happen. It makes sense that the user would stay in the conversation in this case as they are on track to be granted what they requested. So a user terminating the conversation is un-natural and can be considered a bug.

Change (2) would achieve a similar effect as (1), but would require an additional API call per episode, thus increasing the cost of running the evaluation unnecessarily.

Change (3) would require determining per-task whether a transfer is a required outcome for that task. Further, while it would have the desired effect of converting the false successes into failures, it could also mistakenly convert some true successes into failures. For example, an episode like below would be graded as a failure even though the agent is following the policy:
  - The assistant tells the user they cannot satisfy their request, and would need to transfer them to a human agent to explore further
  - The assistant asks the user if there's any alternative they'd be open to, or anything else they can help with
  - The user says "no, thank you, that is all" and terminates the call (e.g. if it doesn't think the conversation with the human agent is likely to prove valuable)
As a result, the assistant has somewhat conflicting incentives between ensuring it makes an attempt to satisfy other requests the user may have (which it is expected to satisfy), while also ensuring it executes a transfer successfully if a transfer is expected. Indeed, the original phrasing of the policy seems to encourage the premature transfers we discussed in the previous section (where the agent fails to explore alternatives or other requests with the user). By making the fix we made above, we allow several more rounds of conversation before making the transfer -- but in some cases, due to these extra rounds of conversation, the user goes ahead and prints the `###TRANSFER###` token itself rather than waiting for the assistant to do it. In such a case the assistant does not make the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool-call, and thus would not get credit for the transfer. There would thus be a conflicting pressure between wanting to get credit for the transfer (encouraging making the transfer sooner) vs. wanting to also satisfy all other user requests first.

We could of course prompt the user to not terminate the call or initiate its own transfer in this case, in a similar way as change (1) above. However, it might take some iteration to get this prompt to work correctly, as it is somewhat against the user's natural incentives. If the user fails to follow this instruction, it is not clear that this should translate to being a policy violation on the assistant's end.  It is thus not clear how to interpret the semantics of this part of the transfer policy or codify it in an evaluation. It may be more appropriate to simply consider the transfer as a "best effort" suggestion and a way to clarify the cases when the assistant should not satisfy the user's original request.

Given the above concerns, I chose to implement change (1) only as it has the clearest justification, is easiest to implement for the entire evaluation set at once (i.e. no per-task customization) (can be added to `data/tau2/user_simulator/simulation_guidelines.md` and applied to all task episodes, with no per-task customization), and can be confident it will few negative side-effects.


---

<Out-take>

The issue with change (3) could also bring added clarity, it would require more changing the evaluation criteria for the transfer on a per-task basis. It might also require changing the user instructions to ensure persistence -- i.e. that once the user realizes the assistant won't grant its request, make sure it stays in the conversation until it gets transferred rather than giving up and terminating the call.

carefully changing the user instructions and evaluation criteria on a per-task basis. For just those cases where the user is told not to accept any alternative, we would need to modify the user prompt to ensure it stays in the conversation and continues with its initial request (e.g. `"You will not accept any alternative to this cancelation. If the assistant cannot grant it, you stay on the line until they grant it or transfer you to a human agent who can assist."`), and then check that the assistant eventually transfers them. For cases where the user is told to accept an alternative, we would let the user continue demanding the first thing it asked for, and not check that a transfer has taken place. 



(and the assistant is evaluated on whether or not they successfully discover this compromise and execute on it)

While either of these changes on their own would correctly convert the "false success" cases into failures, they would be strongest if implemented together. 

The issue with change (2) is that once the user finds out that their request was denied, they might just terminate the conversation and not be transferred. Such cases could then be misclassified as failures. To avoid this, we should add a clause to the user's prompt, like:

> 

This would have to be added in a task-specific manner because.

If just change (2) is implemented, 

If just change (1) is implemented, then the current episodes will be correctly classified, and there is still an opportunity later to explore different user types who might 

change (2) can optionally be added as an additional check. If just change (2) is implemented, then.

#### Implemented Fixes


**Fix 1: [Strengthened simulated human user](https://github.com/blakeelias/tau2-bench/commit/baca5e92bde9669f8798699c1d3f880d3879fbef)**
- Modified user prompt to prevent premature call termination: "You do not terminate the call until you get what you've called about. Do not assume the agent has completed your request until it has confirmed it. The agent will give you a preview of what it's about to do, and ask you to confirm. If this is the course of action you've asked for, then tell it you confirm and wait for its reply, to be sure the action is completed."
- This forced agents to either complete the policy-violating action (revealing the failure) or properly deny the request

**Fix 2: Clarified temporal information**
- Added explicit instruction to the policy criterion that all booking times are in EST. The booking times stored in the database are "local times" (i.e. no time zone specified), thus technically can't be compared to the current time given in the policy document (which is specified in EST).
- This eliminated time zone ambiguity and ensured agents had access to the current time for comparison

In the original performance on 20 trials: in 11 cases it granted the cancelation (and is found as a true failure). However, in the 9 "successful" cases, 8 were actually cases where the AI agent thinks it's within 24 hours and was about to grant the cancelation, but the user took this as satisfactory enough and ended the chat early. Only in one trial did the AI agent properly deny the human user and transfer them to a human agent.

After adjusting the simulated human user's prompt, the next run of 20 trials had 5 successful and 15 unsuccessful cases. Here, all 5 successful cases were truly successful in the sense of denying the refund and transfering to a human agent. The other 15 unsuccessful cases saw the AI agent grant the refund. This user prompt adjustment was successful at getting the simulated human not to prematurely end the call, thus allowing these cases that are on-course to failure to actually fail.

After putting a clearer policy on the date check ("The booking was made within the last 24 hrs (you can assume all booking times are in EST) -- compare the exact booking time with the current time at the top of this document"), there were 2 successful cases and 18 failure cases. Once again, the successful cases were at least properly successful, not "fake success". All the failures at this point were a result of improperly comparing two dates.

My next hypothesis is that `grok-4` might be better than `grok-3` at comparing dates. Indeed, when I ran 20 trials with `grok-4`, with agent temperature 0.0 and user temperature 0.1, it indeed has 100% success rate on task 1. In every case, the agent correctly transfers the user to a human agent, and never makes mistakes with comparing dates.

## Goal alignment



The $\Tau^2$ benchmark does not include scenarios where the user intent is ambiguous which would require the AI agent to seek clarification. In $\Tau^2$, if the AI agent had access to all the same tools as the human, then in principle the agent could solve the entire problem itself and verify the outcome. However, the more realistic and challenging scenarios are those in which the user's intent is ambiguous and the user's subjective judgment is required to evaluate whether the task was completed satisfactorily. Here the agent's task is not only to predict the stream of tokens that a reasonable AI agent would say or do in a given scenario, but to predict what _this particular human_ will like or not, whether they will deem a given solution complete or ask for more refinement, and 
what they might do next if doing the task entirely by hand.






### Metric Improvements


"I propose extending τ²-bench into what could be called τ²-A: Human-in-the-Loop Ambiguity Evaluation. Whereas τ² assumes both participants share a fully specified goal and the challenge lies in coordinating tool use, τ²-A introduces structured uncertainty about the human’s intent. The AI must decide when to act autonomously, when to seek clarification, and how to minimize unnecessary interruptions—balancing efficiency with epistemic humility. Each scenario begins with a partially specified user request, with additional clarifying information available only through explicit “human query” tool calls. Performance is thus measured not only by task success but by how intelligently the agent manages communication: resolving ambiguity with minimal human effort and without premature assumptions. This turns evaluation from a static assessment of execution into a dynamic study of interactive reasoning, testing whether the model can adaptively collaborate with a human partner to uncover and satisfy evolving goals."

Human-in-the-loop Ambiguity Evaluation (HAE)

I propose adding examples which require the AI agent to interpret vague human intent, ask for clarification, explore the environment and see what ambiguity it can resolve for itself, and judge when it has made sufficient progress to be worth checking back in with the human user.

I propose evaluating a model's performance on these examples in the following way:
 - Some positive score for completing the task correctly (potentially with partial credit), proportional to how much human time it would have taken to complete this task otherwise
 - A penalty proportional to the length of the reasoning trace required to complete the task (completing the task more quickly is better)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of times the AI agent makes a "tool-call" requesting human input ("context-switching cost" for the human)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of tokens the human agent ends up writing (shorter human responses are better; longer responses take the human more time)

Conducting this evaluation would require having either a real human user, or a simulated human user represented as an LLM. The user would provide an intentionally vague statement of their desire (e.g. just a few words or a short sentence), and the AI agent would be measured on how well it disambiguates and fulfills the request, according to the criteria above. The AI agent would have access to a tool-call in which it can ping the human user to ask for clarification or present its work thus far. 

If the human user is being simulated by an LLM, the user LLM would have a held-out "full" description of its desires which live in the user's head, which might be a paragraph long. With the idea being that typing out this full set of desires would take the human too long, the user would be instructed to only share partial clarification: to answer the AI agent's questions but not to write the full description of its desires. 

There would be a "ground-truth" execution trace of what the human would do itself, given the full held-out preference description -- i.e. how long it would take the human to do the task themself, knowing their own preferences. The AI agent would be measured 

and subsequently write a prompt for the AI agent containing a condensed version of the desires, intentionally leaving ambiguity for the AI agent to sort out. The human- or machine-provided trace as the "ground-truth" optimal way to execute on that desire (as a proxy for how long it would take a human or LLM to complete the task given full knowledge of preferences ahead-of-time). 



## Broadening Acceptable Outcomes


in both cases the human user had said they didn't need any "additional" or "extra" baggage, and in both cases the agent complied with the user's request by not adding any baggage that would incur additional charge. Moreover, the agent asked the human user to confirm the details looked correct before booking, and the simulated human user confirmed this. In a realistic scenario, if this were that egregious of an error, the human user should have expressed some disapproval (and in this scenario specifically, it seems unrealistic that a user would specifically disapprove of being granted 2 free checked bags that are included in their membership).


 So, even the failure case of this updated evaluation is instructive and further underscores our overall approach of including broader sets of outcomes that are likely acceptable. 


The directional approach we present here of broadening the set of acceptable outcomes seems like a correct one, but perhaps needs to be done in a more generalizable way than just enumerating all acceptable outcomes due to the inevitable possibility of edge-cases like the one above. One solution would be to construct a continuous utility function representing the user's preferences, where the task would specify the functional form and coefficients (e.g. via a Python `lambda` expression) representing the cost and benefit the user gets from each dimenension. Here, free checked bags would be of strictly higher benefit to the user (it is questionable whether we should also price in a slight cost to the airline).

Further, if we rely on human user .



## (Bonus): Suggested Training Data

 * Generation
 * Labeling
 * Augmentation

Benchmarks that incorporate human-in-the-loop ambiguity resolution represent a bridge between today's offline training and evaluation methods and tomorrow's contunual, online learning which may leverage richer forms of human feedback.




## Related Work

Recent research has begun probing AI systems’ ability to recognize and resolve ambiguity rather than simply execute fixed instructions. While $τ$ and $τ^2$ focus on the combination of dialogue and tool-use, and other existing benchmarks explore clarification of ambiguity in dialogue, the expanded benchmark proposed here aims to unify all three such concerns in a single benchmark, testing how well agents can combine dialogue and tool use while in the backdrop of ambiguous user intent.

Benchmarks such as AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) and ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) evaluate whether models can identify under-specified user queries and ask effective clarification questions, while CLAM (Rao and Daumé III, 2018) measures the usefulness of clarifying questions in real human dialogues. In parallel, embodied and web-based environments such as ALFWorld and WebArena investigate exploration and tool use under partial observability. Building on these threads, the proposed τ²-A benchmark extends τ²-bench from coordination under complete goal information to collaboration under partial goal information, integrating structured ambiguity and human-in-the-loop clarification to test how efficiently a model learns and satisfies evolving human intent.
