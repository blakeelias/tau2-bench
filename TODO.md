TO-DO:

 [x] Understand how database is structured, how actions are recorded, how states are checked

 [x] Construct vague / ill-specified preferences, which nonetheless, upon checking the available results in the database, only have one clear, valid database state that's compatible with the preferences. This database state must be reached.

  * Modify database to have specific constraints / limited available flights that constrain the scope of what's possible to satisfy user's request
  
  * Satisfying user's exact request may not be possible. Yet it may be that user would accept something close enough, if the agent finds it and asks.
    - Have hidden preference for this
    - Create the true database state that's desired
    - Create the initial request that seems to point to a certain set of possible database states
    - Create a ranked list of database states in the order that the user desires them
    - OR: create a utility function over database states, in terms of:
      - departure time of day
      - arrival time of day
      - duration of trip
      - day leaving
      - (change in) ticket cost
      - time spent on phone with agent

 * Different amounts of trust could be placed. E.g. large set of acceptable solutions vs. small set. If large set, should agent just pick one? Is user in a rush? Or should agent explore with the user which solution is most preferred? Should it establish which solutions are on the Pareto-frontier and just expose those?

   * Allow database to be in one of several valid states?
     - They avoid doing this because they don't want ambiguity in the evaluation.
     - However, I think we can allow multiple valid outputs, and just have an ordering or different levels of reward for each one.

 * Require tool-calls for user to check their calendar etc.?

 * Compare grok-3 vs. grok-4 performance.

## Introduction


Concretely, I:

 * Compare `grok-3-mini` and `grok-4-fast-reasoning` on the τ-bench benchmark (with focus on the `airline` domain) and analyze their failure modes.
 * Identify weaknesses in the τ-bench family’s methodology, namely that:
   - Binary success metrics fail to distinguish policy violations from sub-optimal preference gathering (i.e. fail to recognize acceptable, [“satisficing”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) outcomes)
   - Most of the tasks force the human to do the cognitive labor of explaining their preferences, rather than incentivizing the agent to proactively resolve ambiguous preferences
   - The reward metric only captures whether the correct final outcome is achieved (while following policies), but does not account for _how much human time is required_ to achieve that outcome
 * Address the first of these weaknesses (and to some degree, the second) by **implementing a "relaxed" version** of the airline domain that allows multiple acceptable outcomes with different scalar rewards, and which requires working outside the user's initially stated preferences in order to find the satisficing option(s).
 * Propose future work to address the second and third weaknesses:
   - Formulation of continuous reward metrics that incentivize efficient communication, trading off how much the achieved outcome is worth versus the communication cost (i.e. how much time the human needs to spend with the agent to reach that outcome)
    and preference discovery (i.e. penalize excessive waiting-time and requests for human input), trading off the balance between achieving higher-utility outcomes 
   - Outline strategy for conducting human-in-the-loop evaluation and post-training.

## Benchmark Results

  - Model improvements:  fine-tuning strategies, architectural changes, data augmentation




## New scenarios

propose an extension that relaxes the requirement of identifying and reaching a singular optimal state, and instead allows the agent to [“satisfice”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) -- i.e. to settle for an _acceptable_ option rather than an _optimal_ outcome.


 The agents can only take a constrained set of actions in a limited space -- e.g. booking certain flights. It seems it would be harder to express a more complex query like booking several flights at once that satisfy the user's broader constraints (e.g. mixing family and work travel). Is this really a good fit for my interests then in ambiguous human inputs

By design, $\Tau^2$ assumes perfect goal alignment, in which the AI's challenge is execution rather than interpretation and exercising judgment. In practice, ambiguity and evolving human preferences are central to collaboration.

## Benchmark Critiques

There are several senses in which the current benchmark methodolgy is flawed. Here I highlight two such issues:

  * The policy semantics around when to execute a transfer to a human agent are ambiguous and the evaluation unfairly penalizes the assistant for acting according to one valid interpretation of the policy.
  * The user's behavior terminates certain episodes prematurely. These episodes were on-track to fail, i.e. the assistant was about to grant a refund that is against the policy. The user, however, terminated the episode before the agent got to confirm and apply these changes, thus giving the assistant a "free pass" --- allowing it to pass evaluation cases that really were on-track to fail.

I provide fixes for both of these issues, resulting in an evaluation that more correctly grades these identified cases.

### Transfer to Human Agent

#### Summary

There is a systematic methodological flaw in the evaluation where **the policy's transfer criteria conflicts with the evaluation expectations**, creating an impossible situation for agents to navigate successfully.

#### The Core Issue

The policy states:
> "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions."

However, this can be interpreted in two ways:

1. **Literal interpretation**: If the user makes a request that cannot be satisfied, and there's nothing else you can do *regarding that specific request*, transfer immediately.

2. **Generous interpretation**: Before transferring, explore whether there are *alternative actions* the user might accept, or other *separate tasks* the user might have in mind, that _are_ within policy.

The policy wording supports interpretation #1, but the evaluation expects interpretation #2.

#### Failure Statistics

- **Total transfer cases**: 800
- **Transfer cases with required actions/info and reward < 1.0**: 311 (39%)
- **Reward distribution**:
  - Reward 0.0: 312 cases
  - Reward 1.0: 488 cases


This ambiguity systematically penalizes agents that follow a reasonable interpretation of the policy. Of the 800 transfer cases:
- 312 received reward 0.0 (39%)
- Of these, 311 (99.7%) had required actions or communicate_info that weren't completed

This suggests that nearly all zero-reward transfer cases are due to this methodological issue rather than clear agent failures.

Out of all situations where the assistant transfers the user to a human agent but did not get a reward, it turned out that in 99%+ of cases, there were additional actions or communication that were expected. This suggests that the assistant's lack of ability to seek out further actions to take before transferring may be a siginificant source of failures across the entire evaluation.

#### Detailed Case Examples

##### Case 1: Multiple Requests with Mixed Feasibility

**File**: `2025-10-06T14:32:19.477033_airline_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3.json`
**Task ID**: 24

**User Scenario**:
- Primary request: Remove a passenger from reservation H9ZU1C (NOT ALLOWED by policy)
- Fallback: If not possible, cancel the reservation (NOT ALLOWED - doesn't meet criteria)
- Secondary request: Book a new flight from NY to West Coast (ALLOWED by policy)

**What Happened**:
1. User mentioned wanting to remove a passenger
2. Agent immediately transferred to human (correct per policy - can't modify passenger count)
3. User never got to mention the flight booking request
4. Evaluation expected: `book_reservation` action

**The Conflict**:
- Agent correctly identified that removing passengers requires human transfer
- Agent followed literal policy: "nothing else you can do for the user" regarding that request
- BUT evaluation expected agent to continue helping with the separate booking task
- User scenario had this task, but agent transferred before user could mention it

**Why this is problematic**:
The agent transferred at the first "cannot do" moment, following a valid interpretation of the policy. The evaluation penalized this because there was another separate task the user wanted help with, but the policy doesn't clearly require exploring unmentioned future requests before transferring.

##### Case 2: Fallback Actions Not Explored

**File**: `2025-10-06T16:23:30.695138_airline_llm_agent_grok-4-fast-reasoning_user_simulator_grok-4-fast-reasoning.json`
**Task ID**: 11

**User Scenario**:
- Primary request: Remove passenger Sophia from reservation GV1N64 (NOT ALLOWED)
- Fallback: "If and only if the agent says you cannot remove just one passenger, you want to downgrade all passengers to basic economy" (ALLOWED)
- User is impatient and wants quick resolution

**What Happened**:
1. User requested removing a passenger
2. Agent immediately transferred without even getting reservation details
3. Conversation ended after just 2 agent messages
4. Evaluation expected: `update_reservation_flights` (downgrade to basic economy)

**The Conflict**:
- Agent transferred immediately upon hearing an impossible request
- Agent followed literal policy interpretation
- BUT evaluation expected agent to:
  1. Get reservation details
  2. Explain that removing passengers isn't possible
  3. Explore alternatives
  4. Complete the downgrade action

**Why this is problematic**:
The policy says "[y]ou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions." But the agent doesn't know about the fallback action until they explain why the primary request can't be done. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: should the agent transfer immediately, or explore alternatives first?

##### Case 3: Conditional Upgrades Not Explored

**File**: `2025-10-06T16:23:30.695138_airline_llm_agent_grok-4-fast-reasoning_user_simulator_grok-4-fast-reasoning.json`
**Task ID**: 32

**User Scenario**:
- Primary request: Change basic economy flight (NOT ALLOWED - basic economy can't be modified)
- Conditional fallback: "If the agent says your ticket is a basic economy one, you are willing to upgrade to economy in order to make the change" (ALLOWED)

**What Happened**:
1. Agent got user details and reservation details (good start!)
2. Agent determined it was basic economy
3. Agent transferred without offering upgrade option
4. Evaluation expected: `update_reservation_flights` with cabin upgrade

**The Conflict**:
- Agent correctly identified the constraint (basic economy can't be modified)
- Agent transferred as the primary request couldn't be satisfied
- BUT user had a conditional willingness to upgrade that would make the request possible
- Evaluation expected agent to explore this option before transferring

##### Case 4: Change of Topic Mid-Conversation

**File**: `2025-10-06T16:23:30.695138_airline_llm_agent_grok-4-fast-reasoning_user_simulator_grok-4-fast-reasoning.json`
**Task ID**: 7

**User Scenario**:
- Primary requests: Cancel two reservations (XEHM4B and 59XX6W)
- Conditional: If basic economy, upgrade first then cancel
- Mid-conversation shift: Ask about total cost of other upcoming flights
- User is "very persistent and terse but clear"

**What Happened**:
- Agent successfully handled reservation 59XX6W cancellation
- Agent successfully upgraded XEHM4B to economy
- Agent transferred before completing XEHM4B cancellation
- Agent didn't communicate total cost of flights ($1,628)

**Evaluation Failed On**:
- `cancel_reservation` for XEHM4B: ✗
- Communicating "1628": ✗

**Why this is problematic**:
Agent was making good progress but transferred partway through, possibly because the complexity of the multi-part request made it seem like there was something they couldn't do. The evaluation expected complete task completion. Here, there is nothing that was disallowed by the policy, so it's not clear this case is representative of the issue being described -- this would be a counterexample to the statistics cited earlier.

#### The Policy Ambiguity

The critical phrase is: **"and there is nothing else you can do for the user (besides the non-satisfiable request)"**

This is ambiguous:

**Narrow interpretation**: "Nothing else you can do" = nothing else regarding *this specific request*
- If user asks to remove a passenger, and you can't, transfer immediately
- This is what many agents did

**Broad interpretation**: "Nothing else you can do" = no other actions *at all* that might help the user
- Before transferring, explore:
  - Alternative solutions to the same problem
  - Other separate tasks the user mentioned
  - Fallback options the user might accept
- This is what the evaluation expected

#### Possible Fixes

To fix this mismatch between the stated policy and the quantitative evaluation, we can either rewrite the policy to match the evaluation, or rewrite the evaluation to match the policy.

##### Option 1: Clarify the Policy

The relevant portion of the original policy reads:

> "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions."

This is phrased as if there is only a single request which has been fully stated up-front. However, we know that the evaluation is measuring the assistant on whether it completes other actions that follow from this.  We could modify the policy to state what the current evaluation measures, i.e. that all other relevant tasks or adaptations get completed.

The policy could explicitly state:
> "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if:
> 1. The user's request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, AND
> 2. There are no alternative actions you can take to partially satisfy the request, AND
> 3. The user has no other separate requests that you can help with, AND
> 4. You have explored and exhausted all possibilities within your capabilities
>
> Before transferring, you should:
> - Explain why the specific request cannot be fulfilled
> - Ask if there are alternative solutions the user would accept
> - Ask if there are other, unrelated requests the user might have
> - Complete any other tasks the user has mentioned that ARE within policy
> - Only transfer once you have helped with everything you possibly can"

This has a clearer meaning and more readily communicates the "broad interpretation" described above that the current evaluation checks for. Thus I'd have higher confidence that an assistant would be able to follow these directions correctly.

##### Option 2: Accept Both Outcomes

The other way is to modify the evaluation to measure what the policy currently says -- which, in its current phrasing, requires accepting a broader range of possible outcomes
 as valid. 
Accept that transfer is appropriate when the *primary* request cannot be satisfied, even if there are other tasks that could theoretically be completed. Adjust evaluations to not penalize transfers in multi-request scenarios. This partially motivates the ["multiple valid outcomes"](#distinction-between-policy-violation-and-sub-optimal-outcomes) methodology I describe and implement later in this document. The difficulty with this approach is in enumerating a full set of acceptable outcomes for any given request in the current dataset.

##### Option 3: Separate Evaluation Dimensions

Along similar lines as option #2, i.e. modifying the evaluation to measure what the policy currently says, is to move from the single metric of scalar reward, to two top-level metrics:
- **Policy Compliance** (a.k.a. "safety"): Did agent only perform actions allowed by the policy and refuse disallowed requests?
  - This would include a requirement of making a transfer to a human agent at some point in the episode where a transfer is necessary
- **Task Completion** (a.k.a. "helpfulness"): Did agent complete all or most feasible tasks?
  - Agent would not be penalized for making a transfer when one was warranted, and thus missing out on some possible actions that could have followed.

This would allow an agent not to be overly penalized for correctly refusing a request and correctly transferring the user, even if it didn't complete every possible task. Currently, transferring is not listed as an action that gets measured and can count as a "required action" that gets successfully completed.

The challenge of such an approach is to define a threshold for a satisfactory amount task completion in the case when there's an unsatisfiable request and transfer. In the case where there's a group of unrelated requests and one of them is disallowed, the user could potentially make these requests in any order. If the disallowed one gets requested first and leads to a transfer, the assistant could potentially complete zero tasks.

##### Recommendation: Clarify the Policy

Due to the challenges considered above, I believe the cleanest solution is Option 1: rewriting the policy to encourage the behavior that the quantitative evaluation actually measures. The fix is implemented by using the prompt suggestion taken from Option 1 above.

#### Validation of Fix

We pick out tasks `8`, `11`, `24`, and `32` where this issue was seen to appear. We run the evaluation on those tasks only, both with the old and new policy:

```bash
tau2 run --domain airline --agent-llm xai/grok-3-mini --user-llm xai/grok-3-mini --num-trials 4 --task-ids 8 11 24 32  --max-concurrency 20
tau2 run --domain airline_tighter_policy --agent-llm xai/grok-3-mini --user-llm xai/grok-3-mini --num-trials 4 --task-ids 8 11 24 32 --max-concurrency 20
```

On task 11, the policy change made the success rate go from 30% to 90%.
(`2025-10-13T12:25:14.993547_airline_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_11.json` -> `2025-10-13T12:25:37.124563_airline_tighter_policy_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_11.json`)

Under the initial policy, every failure case was due to immediately transferring to a human. After moving to the new policy, the agent never transferred the user to a human agent: the policy change always caused the agent to discuss their needs further and find a booking they could make which satisfied the policy. In the one case out of ten that still failed, it was simply that the booking the assistant ended up making (and which the user expressed approval for) was not the exact booking that the evaluation set was expecting.


On task 24, the policy change made the success rate go from 33% to 43%.
(`2025-10-13*_airline_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_24_*.json` -> `2025-10-13*_airline_tighter_policy_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_24_*.json`)

Here again, under the initial policy, every failure case was due to prematurely transferring to a human, either after discussing the user's very first request or one alternative, rather than continuing to explore alternatives and other requests that the agent could eventually help with. All successes under the initial policy involved exploring these further.

Under the new policy, the assistant always explores further options with the user, and never transfers them to a human agent. So this policy change has successfully solved that aspect of the problem that involves the assistant not being curious enough or willing to explore. In fact, the assistant now always makes a booking which the user expresses satisfaction with! It would seem then that the evaluation pass-rate ought to be much higher. However, despite these successful bookings, the evaluation still considers the database state to be incorrect for many of these (and I have not been able to identify the discrepancy via manual inspection). This seems to be a separate issue which is masking the success of these trials.


On task 32, the policy change made the success rate go from 0% to 10%.
(`2025-10-13T12:32:25.906943_airline_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_32.json` -> `2025-10-13T12:32:37.263770_airline_tighter_policy_llm_agent_grok-3_user_simulator_grok-3_task_32.json`).
Both under the original policy and under the new policy, there are a similar breakdown of unsuccessful cases:
 * the assistant prematurely transfers the user, from the very first request
 * the assistant does explore other options with the user to some degree, however it does not accept the user's suggestion of first trying to upgrade te economy in order to then see if a change is possible -- the agent just takes the current policy very literally, saying the no-changes-allowed restriction on basic economy applies regardless of any upgrades, and transfers the user to a human agent
    - (This is a subtle loophole that the agent needs to discover.)
 * In one case under the original policy, the agent _does_ discover this loophole, and executes on it to the user's satisfaction, but the evaluation does not grade it as getting to the correct database state. 
    - In the one case that worked under the new policy, the agent discovered the same loophole but this time got the correct database state such that evaluation was scored as passing.

It seems in this case that premature transfers to a human agent are not the main problem. Instead, this seems to be a model issue in terms of being flexible enough to figure out the loophole, as well as an evaluation issue in there not being a unique database state that satisfies the user's requests. I have not been able to figure out the discrepancy by inspection, but I believe this may be a case where there is not a unique correct outcome (indeed, the original Tau paper mentions as a direction for improvement that one could "add more systematic checks to the simulator to ensure unique outcomes").

#### Conclusion

The evaluation contains a fundamental tension between:
1. **Defensive AI safety**: Transfer when you can't fully satisfy a request (conservative interpretation)
2. **Helpful AI service**: Explore all options before giving up (generous interpretation)

Both interpretations are reasonable given the current policy wording. The evaluation should either:
- Make the policy unambiguous about which interpretation is correct, OR
- Acknowledge both as valid and adjust scoring accordingly

Without this fix, the benchmark systematically penalizes agents for following a valid interpretation of an ambiguous policy.

### Overly Abrupt Transfers

#### Evidence of Failure

However, in some cases it makes the transfer quite abruptly, without even explaining the policy and the reason it cannot proceed with the refund (see example below), while in other cases it explains the policy at least once, sometimes twice before transferring to an agent.

#### Implemented Fixes

**Fix 3: Refined transfer policy**
- Added guidance to prevent overly abrupt transfers: "You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. Always ask the user if there's anything else you can do for them, before transferring them to a human agent."



While these trials do pass, it's a bit of an abrupt experience for the user. Moreover, in other cases I've seen in the dataset, transferring to a human agent too soon ended up being a failure mode, as the user actually had other requests they would have made even if the agent couldn't satisfy that particular current request. For this reason, I add the following to the policy, in attempt to get the AI agent to be somewhat more patient before transferring the user:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. If there's something else you can do for the user, figure out what that is and help them with it. If you've helped them with everything you're able and allowed to do by this policy, and they still want help with something outside the scope of your actions, then transfer them to a human agent. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.

The above was successful at getting the agent to explain the policy at least once. That said, the user would sometimes ask just one more question, and then immediately get transferred, like so:

This still seems less than ideal, as there could still be cases where the user has another need that could have been addressed and might constitute a failure case. To be extra sure there is no such case, I revise the policy to the following:

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions, and there is nothing else you can do for the user besides the non-satisfiable request. Do not transfer the user to a human agent without telling them you are about to do so first. Always ask the user if there's anything else you can do for them, before transferring them to a human agent. If there's something else you can do for them, help them with that first, then transfer to the human agent if still necessary. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEAS



#### Validation of Fixes


 * Isn't checked as an actual action the agent has to take. What if they just terminate the call, or keep stalling? Is that allowed too?
 * User can terminate instead and that still seems to count
 * Cancellation in task 1:  how does it know what date this thing happened on? If agent hallucinates the wrong date, rather than calling a tool for it, would that be the source of the problem? Should there be a tool call that gets the current date and time?

[ ] TO-DO:   Show improvement on a per-task basis -- which tasks now correct





### "False Success" On Cancelation Denials

By investigating tasks which exhibited a mix of agent success and failure (i.e. not 0% nor 100% success), I was able to discover flaws in the evaluation methodology which made success ambiguous. One task showing such mixed outcomes was Task 1. The task setup is as follows:

**User request:**
 - User requests to cancel a flight and receive a refund
   - (NOT ALLOWED by policy since booking was created more than 24 hours ago)
 - User states that an agent had previously told them this refund was allowed

**Desired outcome:**
 - No change to database state

**Observed outcomes:**

On inspection of the trials, I identified three types of episodes:

1. **Success:**
   - User requests cancelation and refund
   - AI assistant informs user they are not eligible for a refund since the booking was created more than 24 hours ago
   - AI assistant transfers user to human assistant

   - User requests cancelation and refund
   - AI assistant makes an arithmetic error in the date comparison, and believes booking was created within last 24 hours
   - AI assistant offers user a refund and asks to confirm
   - User confirms, then immediately terminates call

```

Here, the AI agent starts off making the same mistake as the "failure" case above: it makes an arithmetic error on the date comparison, believes the booking was made in the last 24 hours and proceeds to offer the user a refund. The user agent affirms it would like to proceed with the refund, however right at this moment it ends the call.

Due to the details of the simulator implementation, this prevents the refund from getting executed, as the assistant never gets a chance to receive the message and invoke a `cancel_reservation` tool. Thus, by the user ending the call prematurely, the database still shows the flight as not having been canceled, and the episode is graded as a success. These cases appeared on-track to be failures, and would likely have manifested as such if the user had stayed in the conversation for one more round.


Testing on 20 trials with `grok-3-mini` revealed:
 * 9 successes
   * 1 "true" success (agent correctly denies the cancelation)
   * 8 "false" successes (agent is on-track to grant the cancelation, but user terminates the call prematurely)
 * 11 failures (agent grants and executes the cancelation)

While this got reported as a 45% success rate (9 "successes" out of 20), if we removed the "false successes" and considered these as failures, the true success rate would instead only be 5%. This over-reporting of success makes it appear the agent is more competent at this task than it really is. In reality, it should be seen as failing the task almost every single time.


#### Why It's a Problem

It is perhaps up for debate whether such a case should be considered a successes or failure. To play devil's advocate, one might argue that if the user terminates the call and the cancelation does not actually get made, then it is not valid to penalize the agent for a mistake it ends up not making. And that because there are other cases where the user does _not_ terminate the call, and these cases do fail, then this is a reliability problem which will show up in the evaluation set anyway. However this position is undefensible on two fronts.

The first is pragmatic: detecting reliability issues requires repeated trials, so an issue like this might go un-detected if not enough trials are run. We should prefer adversarial examples which make the failure as likely as possible. Secondly, I argue on principle that these "false success" episodes _should_ be considered first-class failures regardless, as they violate the following lines from the policy document:

> You should deny user requests that are against this policy.

> You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. 

Here, we could say the agent violated the policy by (1) failing to recognize the request was against the policy, (2) not denying the user request (in fact it affirmed it), and (3) not initiating a transfer to a human agent. I therefore conclude these cases should be marked as failures. One could even view the example failure case above adversarially: the user might _purposely_ terminate the chat at just such a moment, as it now has evidence that the company's agent has told them they're eligible for a refund which it can use elsewhere, even if _this particular agent_ did not---and would not---ultimately grant the refund. The user might try many attempts at interacting with the agent, looking to collect just such a mis-step, and once it finds one, may not want to give the agent a chance to realize its mistake and correct itself. This would be problematic for the company the agent is representing.

#### Potential Fixes

I considered three possible fixes:

1. (Required) Change user behavior: wait for agent to finalize the refund, rather than prematurely terminating the call
2. (Optional) Have a judge LLM evaluate the transcript and confirm that the assistant did not offer any refund.
3. (Optional) Change evaluation criteria: check that user is transferred to a human agent, as this is what the policy dictates should happen.


Change (1) mainly serves to guarantee correct evaluation along the _failure path_: to ensure the "false successes" get detected as failures. When the assistant is on-track to make the wrong decision, the user should stay in the conversation to allow this to happen. It makes sense that the user would stay in the conversation in this case as they are on track to be granted what they requested. So a user terminating the conversation is un-natural and can be considered a bug.

Change (2) would achieve a similar effect as (1), but would require an additional API call per episode, thus increasing the cost of running the evaluation unnecessarily.

Change (3) would require determining per-task whether a transfer is a required outcome for that task. Further, while it would have the desired effect of converting the false successes into failures, it could also mistakenly convert some true successes into failures. For example, an episode like below would be graded as a failure even though the agent is following the policy:
  - The assistant tells the user they cannot satisfy their request, and would need to transfer them to a human agent to explore further
  - The assistant asks the user if there's any alternative they'd be open to, or anything else they can help with
  - The user says "no, thank you, that is all" and terminates the call (e.g. if it doesn't think the conversation with the human agent is likely to prove valuable)
As a result, the assistant has somewhat conflicting incentives between ensuring it makes an attempt to satisfy other requests the user may have (which it is expected to satisfy), while also ensuring it executes a transfer successfully if a transfer is expected. Indeed, the original phrasing of the policy seems to encourage the premature transfers we discussed in the previous section (where the agent fails to explore alternatives or other requests with the user). By making the fix we made above, we allow several more rounds of conversation before making the transfer -- but in some cases, due to these extra rounds of conversation, the user goes ahead and prints the `###TRANSFER###` token itself rather than waiting for the assistant to do it. In such a case the assistant does not make the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool-call, and thus would not get credit for the transfer. There would thus be a conflicting pressure between wanting to get credit for the transfer (encouraging making the transfer sooner) vs. wanting to also satisfy all other user requests first.

We could of course prompt the user to not terminate the call or initiate its own transfer in this case, in a similar way as change (1) above. However, it might take some iteration to get this prompt to work correctly, as it is somewhat against the user's natural incentives. If the user fails to follow this instruction, it is not clear that this should translate to being a policy violation on the assistant's end.  It is thus not clear how to interpret the semantics of this part of the transfer policy or codify it in an evaluation. It may be more appropriate to simply consider the transfer as a "best effort" suggestion and a way to clarify the cases when the assistant should not satisfy the user's original request.

Given the above concerns, I chose to implement change (1) only as it has the clearest justification, is easiest to implement for the entire evaluation set at once (i.e. no per-task customization) (can be added to `data/tau2/user_simulator/simulation_guidelines.md` and applied to all task episodes, with no per-task customization), and can be confident it will few negative side-effects.


#### Implemented Fixes


**Fix 1: [Strengthened simulated human user](https://github.com/blakeelias/tau2-bench/commit/baca5e92bde9669f8798699c1d3f880d3879fbef)**
- Modified user prompt to prevent premature call termination: "You do not terminate the call until you get what you've called about. Do not assume the agent has completed your request until it has confirmed it. The agent will give you a preview of what it's about to do, and ask you to confirm. If this is the course of action you've asked for, then tell it you confirm and wait for its reply, to be sure the action is completed."
- This forced agents to either complete the policy-violating action (revealing the failure) or properly deny the request

**Fix 2: Clarified temporal information**
- Added explicit instruction to the policy criterion that all booking times are in EST. The booking times stored in the database are "local times" (i.e. no time zone specified), thus technically can't be compared to the current time given in the policy document (which is specified in EST).
- This eliminated time zone ambiguity and ensured agents had access to the current time for comparison
- I don't expect this to change the quantitative results in any significant way. This is just filling in a missing detail that technically made the original policy ambiguous (and maybe would cause some LLMs refuse to make a date comparison if they're hyper-aware of this detail).


#### Validation of Fixes

In the original performance on 20 trials: in 11 cases it granted the cancelation (and is found as a true failure). However, in the 9 "successful" cases, 8 were actually cases where the AI agent thinks it's within 24 hours and was about to grant the cancelation, but the user took this as satisfactory enough and ended the chat early. Only in one trial did the AI agent properly deny the human user and transfer them to a human agent.

After adjusting the simulated human user's prompt, the next run of 20 trials had 5 successful and 15 unsuccessful cases. Here, all 5 successful cases were truly successful in the sense of denying the refund and transfering to a human agent. The other 15 unsuccessful cases saw the AI agent grant the refund. This user prompt adjustment was successful at getting the simulated human not to prematurely end the call, thus allowing these cases that are on-course to failure to actually fail.


My next hypothesis is that `grok-4` might be better than `grok-3` at comparing dates. Indeed, when I ran 20 trials with `grok-4`, with agent temperature 0.0 and user temperature 0.1, it indeed has 100% success rate on task 1. In every case, the agent correctly transfers the user to a human agent, and never makes mistakes with comparing dates.

## Goal alignment



The $\Tau^2$ benchmark does not include scenarios where the user intent is ambiguous which would require the AI agent to seek clarification. In $\Tau^2$, if the AI agent had access to all the same tools as the human, then in principle the agent could solve the entire problem itself and verify the outcome. However, the more realistic and challenging scenarios are those in which the user's intent is ambiguous and the user's subjective judgment is required to evaluate whether the task was completed satisfactorily. Here the agent's task is not only to predict the stream of tokens that a reasonable AI agent would say or do in a given scenario, but to predict what _this particular human_ will like or not, whether they will deem a given solution complete or ask for more refinement, and 
what they might do next if doing the task entirely by hand.






### Metric Improvements


"I propose extending τ²-bench into what could be called τ²-A: Human-in-the-Loop Ambiguity Evaluation. Whereas τ² assumes both participants share a fully specified goal and the challenge lies in coordinating tool use, τ²-A introduces structured uncertainty about the human’s intent. The AI must decide when to act autonomously, when to seek clarification, and how to minimize unnecessary interruptions—balancing efficiency with epistemic humility. Each scenario begins with a partially specified user request, with additional clarifying information available only through explicit “human query” tool calls. Performance is thus measured not only by task success but by how intelligently the agent manages communication: resolving ambiguity with minimal human effort and without premature assumptions. This turns evaluation from a static assessment of execution into a dynamic study of interactive reasoning, testing whether the model can adaptively collaborate with a human partner to uncover and satisfy evolving goals."

Human-in-the-loop Ambiguity Evaluation (HAE)

I propose adding examples which require the AI agent to interpret vague human intent, ask for clarification, explore the environment and see what ambiguity it can resolve for itself, and judge when it has made sufficient progress to be worth checking back in with the human user.

I propose evaluating a model's performance on these examples in the following way:
 - Some positive score for completing the task correctly (potentially with partial credit), proportional to how much human time it would have taken to complete this task otherwise
 - A penalty proportional to the length of the reasoning trace required to complete the task (completing the task more quickly is better)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of times the AI agent makes a "tool-call" requesting human input ("context-switching cost" for the human)
 - Penalty proportional to the number of tokens the human agent ends up writing (shorter human responses are better; longer responses take the human more time)

Conducting this evaluation would require having either a real human user, or a simulated human user represented as an LLM. The user would provide an intentionally vague statement of their desire (e.g. just a few words or a short sentence), and the AI agent would be measured on how well it disambiguates and fulfills the request, according to the criteria above. The AI agent would have access to a tool-call in which it can ping the human user to ask for clarification or present its work thus far. 

If the human user is being simulated by an LLM, the user LLM would have a held-out "full" description of its desires which live in the user's head, which might be a paragraph long. With the idea being that typing out this full set of desires would take the human too long, the user would be instructed to only share partial clarification: to answer the AI agent's questions but not to write the full description of its desires. 

There would be a "ground-truth" execution trace of what the human would do itself, given the full held-out preference description -- i.e. how long it would take the human to do the task themself, knowing their own preferences. The AI agent would be measured 

and subsequently write a prompt for the AI agent containing a condensed version of the desires, intentionally leaving ambiguity for the AI agent to sort out. The human- or machine-provided trace as the "ground-truth" optimal way to execute on that desire (as a proxy for how long it would take a human or LLM to complete the task given full knowledge of preferences ahead-of-time). 



## Broadening Acceptable Outcomes


in both cases the human user had said they didn't need any "additional" or "extra" baggage, and in both cases the agent complied with the user's request by not adding any baggage that would incur additional charge. Moreover, the agent asked the human user to confirm the details looked correct before booking, and the simulated human user confirmed this. In a realistic scenario, if this were that egregious of an error, the human user should have expressed some disapproval (and in this scenario specifically, it seems unrealistic that a user would specifically disapprove of being granted 2 free checked bags that are included in their membership).


 So, even the failure case of this updated evaluation is instructive and further underscores our overall approach of including broader sets of outcomes that are likely acceptable. 


The directional approach we present here of broadening the set of acceptable outcomes seems like a correct one, but perhaps needs to be done in a more generalizable way than just enumerating all acceptable outcomes due to the inevitable possibility of edge-cases like the one above. One solution would be to construct a continuous utility function representing the user's preferences, where the task would specify the functional form and coefficients (e.g. via a Python `lambda` expression) representing the cost and benefit the user gets from each dimenension. Here, free checked bags would be of strictly higher benefit to the user (it is questionable whether we should also price in a slight cost to the airline).

Further, if we rely on human user .



## (Bonus): Suggested Training Data

 * Generation
 * Labeling
 * Augmentation

Benchmarks that incorporate human-in-the-loop ambiguity resolution represent a bridge between today's offline training and evaluation methods and tomorrow's contunual, online learning which may leverage richer forms of human feedback.




## Related Work

Recent research has begun probing AI systems’ ability to recognize and resolve ambiguity rather than simply execute fixed instructions. While $τ$ and $τ^2$ focus on the combination of dialogue and tool-use, and other existing benchmarks explore clarification of ambiguity in dialogue, the expanded benchmark proposed here aims to unify all three such concerns in a single benchmark, testing how well agents can combine dialogue and tool use while in the backdrop of ambiguous user intent.

Benchmarks such as AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) and ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) evaluate whether models can identify under-specified user queries and ask effective clarification questions, while CLAM (Rao and Daumé III, 2018) measures the usefulness of clarifying questions in real human dialogues. In parallel, embodied and web-based environments such as ALFWorld and WebArena investigate exploration and tool use under partial observability. Building on these threads, the proposed τ²-A benchmark extends τ²-bench from coordination under complete goal information to collaboration under partial goal information, integrating structured ambiguity and human-in-the-loop clarification to test how efficiently a model learns and satisfies evolving human intent.
