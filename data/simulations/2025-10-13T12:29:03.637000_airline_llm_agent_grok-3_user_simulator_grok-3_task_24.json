Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- You do not terminate the conversation until you get everything you've called about taken care of, or some acceptable compromise or alternative.\n- Do not assume the agent has completed your request until it has confirmed it.\n- The agent will give you a preview of what it's about to do, and ask you to confirm. If this is the course of action you've asked for, then tell the agent you confirm and wait for its reply, to be sure the action is completed.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

      "policy": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users **book**, **modify**, or **cancel** flight reservations. You also handle **refunds and compensation**.\n\nBefore taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, changing cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n### User\nEach user has a profile containing:\n- user id\n- email\n- addresses\n- date of birth\n- payment methods\n- membership level\n- reservation numbers\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **credit card**, **gift card**, **travel certificate**.\n\nThere are three membership levels: **regular**, **silver**, **gold**.\n\n### Flight\nEach flight has the following attributes:\n- flight number\n- origin\n- destination\n- scheduled departure and arrival time (local time)\n\nA flight can be available at multiple dates. For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need, even if they are no-charge due to the user's membership level.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.",

I've searched for round-trip flights from New York (EWR and JFK) to various West Coast destinations for your travel dates, May 20 (departure) and May 25 (return), focusing on the most affordable options in basic economy as requested. Below are the best options I found:\n\n1. **New York (JFK) to Seattle (SEA) Round-Trip in Basic Economy:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT069, departing JFK at 06:00 EST, arriving SEA at 12:00 EST, price: $51\n   - **Return (May 25):** Flight HAT276, departing SEA at 18:00 EST, arriving JFK at 00:00 EST (next day), price: $55\n   - **Total Cost for Round-Trip:** $106 per passenger\n\n2. **New York (EWR) to Los Angeles (LAX) Round-Trip in Basic Economy:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT041, departing EWR at 07:00 EST, arriving LAX at 12:30 EST, price: $86\n   - **Return (May 25):** Flight HAT012, departing LAX at 12:00 EST, arriving EWR at 17:30 EST, price: $77\n   - **Total Cost for Round-Trip:** $163 per passenger\n   - **Note:** The return flight HAT041 from LAX to EWR on May 25 has no basic economy seats available, so I selected the next cheapest option in basic economy.\n\n3. **New York (JFK) to San Francisco (SFO) Round-Trip:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT023, departing JFK at 14:00 EST, arriving SFO at 20:00 EST, price: $100 (basic economy)\n   - **Return (May 25):** No direct flights available from SFO to JFK on this date.\n   - **Note:** Since there are no return flights available, I cannot offer a complete round-trip for this destination.\n\nBased on the search results, the cheapest round-trip option is from JFK to Seattle (SEA) for $106 per passenger in basic economy. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with booking this option, or if you'd prefer another destination or cabin class. I\u2019ll also need the following details to complete the booking:\n\n- Number of passengers (up to 5) and their information (first name, last name, date of birth for each)\n- Whether you\u2019d like to add travel insurance ($30 per passenger)\n- Number of checked bags needed (if any, beyond free allowance based on your membership level)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can finalize the booking for you. If you have any other preferences or questions, I'm here to help.",

              "content": "Thank you for waiting, Mia. I've searched for round-trip flights from New York (EWR and JFK) to various West Coast destinations for your travel dates, May 20 (departure) and May 25 (return), focusing on the most affordable options in basic economy as requested. Below are the best options I found:\n\n1. **New York (JFK) to Seattle (SEA) Round-Trip in Basic Economy:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT069, departing JFK at 06:00 EST, arriving SEA at 12:00 EST, price: $51\n   - **Return (May 25):** Flight HAT276, departing SEA at 18:00 EST, arriving JFK at 00:00 EST (next day), price: $55\n   - **Total Cost for Round-Trip:** $106 per passenger\n\n2. **New York (EWR) to Los Angeles (LAX) Round-Trip in Basic Economy:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT041, departing EWR at 07:00 EST, arriving LAX at 12:30 EST, price: $86\n   - **Return (May 25):** Flight HAT012, departing LAX at 12:00 EST, arriving EWR at 17:30 EST, price: $77\n   - **Total Cost for Round-Trip:** $163 per passenger\n   - **Note:** The return flight HAT041 from LAX to EWR on May 25 has no basic economy seats available, so I selected the next cheapest option in basic economy.\n\n3. **New York (JFK) to San Francisco (SFO) Round-Trip:**\n   - **Outbound (May 20):** Flight HAT023, departing JFK at 14:00 EST, arriving SFO at 20:00 EST, price: $100 (basic economy)\n   - **Return (May 25):** No direct flights available from SFO to JFK on this date.\n   - **Note:** Since there are no return flights available, I cannot offer a complete round-trip for this destination.\n\nBased on the search results, the cheapest round-trip option is from JFK to Seattle (SEA) for $106 per passenger in basic economy. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with booking this option, or if you'd prefer another destination or cabin class. I\u2019ll also need the following details to complete the booking:\n\n- Number of passengers (up to 5) and their information (first name, last name, date of birth for each)\n- Whether you\u2019d like to add travel insurance ($30 per passenger)\n- Number of checked bags needed (if any, beyond free allowance based on your membership level)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can finalize the booking for you. If you have any other preferences or questions, I'm here to help.",
