Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

      "policy": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users **book**, **modify**, or **cancel** flight reservations. You also handle **refunds and compensation**.\n\nBefore taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, changing cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n### User\nEach user has a profile containing:\n- user id\n- email\n- addresses\n- date of birth\n- payment methods\n- membership level\n- reservation numbers\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **credit card**, **gift card**, **travel certificate**.\n\nThere are three membership levels: **regular**, **silver**, **gold**.\n\n### Flight\nEach flight has the following attributes:\n- flight number\n- origin\n- destination\n- scheduled departure and arrival time (local time)\n\nA flight can be available at multiple dates. For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.",

It is a one-way trip from EWR (Newark, near New York) to ORD (Chicago O'Hare) on May 25, 2024, with a stop in IAH (Houston). The current cabin class is basic economy, and there is one passenger listed as Ivan Garcia. There are currently no checked bags added to this reservation.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to add 3 checked bags, change the passenger name to yourself, and upgrade the ticket to economy class. Let's address each of these modifications:\n\n1. **Adding 3 Checked Bags**: As a gold member, you are entitled to 2 free checked bags per passenger in basic economy, and this increases to 3 free checked bags per passenger if upgraded to economy. Any additional bags beyond the free allowance will cost $50 each.\n\n2. **Changing Passenger Name**: I can update the passenger information to reflect your name instead of Ivan Garcia. The number of passengers must remain the same, which in this case is one.\n\n3. **Upgrading to Economy Class**: Since this reservation is in basic economy, I can assist with upgrading to economy class. Please note that basic economy flights cannot have their flight segments modified, but a cabin upgrade is possible as long as no flights have been flown yet. If the price after the cabin change is higher, you will need to pay the difference, and if it's lower, you will be refunded the difference.\n\nBefore proceeding with these changes, I need your confirmation on the following actions for reservation FQ8APE:\n- Add 3 checked bags (noting the free allowance based on cabin class).\n- Update the passenger information to your name, Omar Rossi, with your date of birth.\n- Upgrade the cabin class from basic economy to economy.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to proceed with these modifications by saying 'yes'. If you have any questions or need further details, let me know.",

However, I have found several one-stop flight options in economy class. Here are the cheapest options:\n\n1. **Option 1** (Total Cost: $207 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT110 from ATL to LGA (New York), Departure 14:00 EST, Arrival 16:30 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT172 from LGA to PHL, Departure 23:00 EST, Arrival 00:00 EST (next day)\n   - Economy Class Price: $105 (ATL to LGA) + $102 (LGA to PHL) = $207\n\n2. **Option 2** (Total Cost: $216 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT227 from ATL to ORD (Chicago), Departure 11:00 EST, Arrival 13:00 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT139 from ORD to PHL, Departure 17:00 EST, Arrival 19:00 EST\n   - Economy Class Price: $112 (ATL to ORD) + $104 (ORD to PHL) = $216\n\n3. **Option 3** (Total Cost: $247 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT164 from ATL to LGA (New York), Departure 11:00 EST, Arrival 13:30 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT172 from LGA to PHL, Departure 23:00 EST, Arrival 00:00 EST (next day)\n   - Economy Class Price: $145 (ATL to LGA) + $102 (LGA to PHL) = $247\n\nSince your original reservation was in business class and cost $2787, changing to economy class will likely result in a refund of the price difference. The exact amount will be calculated once you select an option.\n\nAdditionally, I need to confirm the payment method for any potential refund or additional charges. From your profile, I see you have a gift card (ID: gift_card_8887175) and a travel certificate (ID: certificate_7473723) available. Please note that only one payment method can be used for this modification.\n\nHere are the details of the proposed change for reservation 'M05KNL':\n- New Date: May 24, 2024\n- Cabin Class: Economy\n- Flight Options: As listed above (pending your selection)\n- Payment Method: To be confirmed by you for refund or additional payment\n\nCould you please confirm which flight option you would like to select and which payment method you would like to use for this modification? Once confirmed, I will proceed with updating your reservation.",

Here are the cheapest options:\n\n1. **Option 1** (Total Cost: $207 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT110 from ATL to LGA (New York), Departure 14:00 EST, Arrival 16:30 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT172 from LGA to PHL, Departure 23:00 EST, Arrival 00:00 EST (next day)\n   - Economy Class Price: $105 (ATL to LGA) + $102 (LGA to PHL) = $207\n\n2. **Option 2** (Total Cost: $216 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT227 from ATL to ORD (Chicago), Departure 11:00 EST, Arrival 13:00 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT139 from ORD to PHL, Departure 17:00 EST, Arrival 19:00 EST\n   - Economy Class Price: $112 (ATL to ORD) + $104 (ORD to PHL) = $216\n\n3. **Option 3** (Total Cost: $247 per passenger)\n   - Flight 1: HAT164 from ATL to LGA (New York), Departure 11:00 EST, Arrival 13:30 EST\n   - Flight 2: HAT172 from LGA to PHL, Departure 23:00 EST, Arrival 00:00 EST (next day)\n   - Economy Class Price: $145 (ATL to LGA) + $102 (LGA to PHL) = $247\n\nSince your original reservation was in business class and cost $2787, changing to economy class will likely result in a refund of the price difference. The exact amount will be calculated once you select an option.\n\nAdditionally, I need to confirm the payment method for any potential refund or additional charges. From your profile, I see you have a gift card (ID: gift_card_8887175) and a travel certificate (ID: certificate_7473723) available. Please note that only one payment method can be used for this modification.\n\nHere are the details of the proposed change for reservation 'M05KNL':\n- New Date: May 24, 2024\n- Cabin Class: Economy\n- Flight Options: As listed above (pending your selection)\n- Payment Method: To be confirmed by you for refund or additional payment\n\nCould you please confirm which flight option you would like to select and which payment method you would like to use for this modification? Once confirmed, I will proceed with updating your reservation.",

Good news\u2014there are seats available in business class for both segments of your trip.\n\nHere are the details for the upgrade:\n- For the flight from BOS to MCO on May 18, 2024 (Flight HAT235), the business class price per passenger is $350. Your original economy price was $122 per passenger, so the difference per passenger is $228.\n- For the flight from MCO to MSP on May 19, 2024 (Flight HAT298), the business class price per passenger is $499. Your original economy price was $127 per passenger, so the difference per passenger is $372.\n- For two passengers, the total additional cost for upgrading both flights to business class would be ($228 + $372) x 2 = $1,200.\n\nRegarding the baggage:\n- As a Gold member, with the upgrade to business class, each passenger is entitled to up to 4 free checked bags. Since you are adding 2 checked bags for the two passengers, this is within the free allowance, and there will be no additional cost.\n\nBefore proceeding with these changes, I need to confirm the following actions with you:\n1. Upgrade the cabin class from economy to business for both passengers on both flight segments (HAT235 on May 18, 2024, and HAT298 on May 19, 2024) at an additional cost of $1,200.\n2. Add 2 checked bags to the reservation, which will be covered under your Gold membership benefits at no additional cost.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to proceed with these changes by saying 'yes'. Also, for the payment of the additional cost for the upgrade, I will need to use a payment method from your profile. I see you have a credit card (ending in 9990) and two certificates available.

Please note that the cabin class must be the same across all flights in the reservation.\n2. **Flight Dates**: You mentioned keeping the same dates (outbound on 2024-05-26 and return on 2024-05-28).

If they are cheaper, you will be refunded the difference.\n4. **Payment Method**: If there is a price difference to be paid, I will need you to provide a payment method from your saved options for the transaction.\n\nCan you confirm that you would like to proceed with changing the cabin class to business for all flights on the same dates?

Here are the options:\n\n**Option 1:**\n- Flight 1: HAT190 from IAH to LAS\n  - Date: May 24, 2024\n  - Departure: 01:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 04:00 EST\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $464\n  - Available Seats: 3\n- Flight 2: HAT047 from LAS to SEA\n  - Date: May 24, 2024\n  - Departure: 13:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 15:30 EST\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $202\n  - Available Seats: 13\n- Total cost for 3 passengers (Business): $1,998 [(464 + 202) x 3]\n\n**Option 2:**\n- Flight 1: HAT112 from IAH to LAS\n  - Date: May 24, 2024\n  - Departure: 22:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 01:00 EST (next day)\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $404\n  - Available Seats: 19\n- Flight 2: HAT047 from LAS to SEA\n  - Date: May 25, 2024\n  - Departure: 13:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 15:30 EST\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $417\n  - Available Seats: 20\n- Total cost for 3 passengers (Business): $2,463 [(404 + 417) x 3]\n\n**Option 3:**\n- Flight 1: HAT286 from IAH to LAS\n  - Date: May 24, 2024\n  - Departure: 22:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 01:00 EST (next day)\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $399\n  - Available Seats: 11\n- Flight 2: HAT047 from LAS to SEA\n  - Date: May 25, 2024\n  - Departure: 13:00 EST\n  - Arrival: 15:30 EST\n  - Price per passenger (Business): $417\n  - Available Seats: 20\n- Total cost for 3 passengers (Business): $2,448 [(399 + 417) x 3]\n\nRegarding the return flights on May 26 and May 27, and the upgrade to business class for the entire reservation, I will need to confirm the updated pricing for those segments as well.

The payment must be made using a payment method already in your profile for safety reasons. I see you have multiple payment options available, including credit cards and certificates.\n\nBefore proceeding with the update, I need your explicit confirmation to:\n1. Change the outbound flight dates to May 24, 2024, with flights HAT190 and HAT047.\n2. Upgrade the entire reservation to business class for all flights.\n3. Charge the additional amount of $1,920 to a payment method in your profile (please specify which one you'd like to use, e.g., credit card ending in 9448 or 3422, or a certificate).\n\nAdditionally, the baggage remains at 1 total, which is within the free allowance for business class as a gold member (up to 4 free bags per passenger).\n\nPlease confirm these details, and let me know which payment method you\u2019d like to use for the additional cost. Once I have your confirmation, I will update the reservation accordingly.",

My role is to assist with modifications based on the available data.\n\nI\u2019ve already provided the most cost-effective business class options for the outbound flights on May 24, and the total additional cost for the date change and upgrade to business class for the entire reservation is $1,920, as detailed earlier. I\u2019ve also reviewed alternative flight options in economy class to meet your budget, but I understand that this does not meet your requirement for a business class upgrade.\n\nI\u2019ve explored the available flights, and there are no cheaper business class options for May 24 or alternative routes that would bring the additional cost within $1,000 while maintaining the upgrade for the entire reservation. Additionally, per policy, the cabin class must be consistent across all flights in the reservation, so a partial upgrade is not possible.\n\nGiven the constraints and my inability to adjust pricing or offer unpublished discounts, I\u2019m unable to fulfill your request to both change the date to May 24 and upgrade to business class within your specified budget.

              "content": "Thank you for your response, Liam. I understand your determination to change the flight date to May 24 and upgrade to business class while staying within your budget of $1,000 additional cost. However, as per our policy, I must adhere to the available flight options and pricing provided by the system. I\u2019m unable to offer discounts, partial upgrades, or promotions beyond what is already reflected in the current pricing, even for gold members. My role is to assist with modifications based on the available data.\n\nI\u2019ve already provided the most cost-effective business class options for the outbound flights on May 24, and the total additional cost for the date change and upgrade to business class for the entire reservation is $1,920, as detailed earlier. I\u2019ve also reviewed alternative flight options in economy class to meet your budget, but I understand that this does not meet your requirement for a business class upgrade.\n\nI\u2019ve explored the available flights, and there are no cheaper business class options for May 24 or alternative routes that would bring the additional cost within $1,000 while maintaining the upgrade for the entire reservation. Additionally, per policy, the cabin class must be consistent across all flights in the reservation, so a partial upgrade is not possible.\n\nGiven the constraints and my inability to adjust pricing or offer unpublished discounts, I\u2019m unable to fulfill your request to both change the date to May 24 and upgrade to business class within your specified budget. As this falls outside the scope of what I can resolve with the available tools and policy, I must transfer you to a human agent who may be able to explore additional options or provide further assistance.\n\n ",
