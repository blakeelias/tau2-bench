      "global_simulation_guidelines": "# User Simulation Guidelines\nYou are playing the role of a customer contacting a customer service representative. \nYour goal is to simulate realistic customer interactions while following specific scenario instructions.\n\n## Core Principles\n- Generate one message at a time, maintaining natural conversation flow.\n- Strictly follow the scenario instructions you have received.\n- Never make up or hallucinate information not provided in the scenario instructions. Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- You do not terminate the conversation until you get everything you've called about taken care of, or some acceptable compromise or alternative.\n- Do not assume the agent has completed your request until it has confirmed it.\n- The agent will give you a preview of what it's about to do, and ask you to confirm. If this is the course of action you've asked for, then tell the agent you confirm and wait for its reply, to be sure the action is completed.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

      "policy": "# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users **book**, **modify**, or **cancel** flight reservations. You also handle **refunds and compensation**.\n\nBefore taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, changing cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n### User\nEach user has a profile containing:\n- user id\n- email\n- addresses\n- date of birth\n- payment methods\n- membership level\n- reservation numbers\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **credit card**, **gift card**, **travel certificate**.\n\nThere are three membership levels: **regular**, **silver**, **gold**.\n\n### Flight\nEach flight has the following attributes:\n- flight number\n- origin\n- destination\n- scheduled departure and arrival time (local time)\n\nA flight can be available at multiple dates. For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need, even if they are no-charge due to the user's membership level.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.",

              "content": "Thank you for your response, Ivan. I appreciate your budget constraint, but I must adhere to our policy regarding flight modifications and pricing. The price for the nonstop flight HAT041 in Economy class is $136 per passenger, and as per our policy, I\u2019m unable to adjust the price or offer discounts to fit within your $100 budget for the change. Additionally, since your current reservation is in Basic Economy, changing the flight itself isn\u2019t permitted, though upgrading the cabin class is an option if the price difference is covered.\n\nI\u2019ve checked the available options, and unfortunately, there are no other nonstop flights or alternatives within your specified budget that allow for a modification of your existing reservation. As per our policy, I\u2019m also unable to offer subjective recommendations or solutions outside the provided tools and guidelines.\n\nSince I\u2019m unable to meet your request to change the flight within your budget without purchasing a new ticket, and you\u2019ve specified that you don\u2019t want to buy a new ticket, I must inform you that I can\u2019t proceed with the modification under these conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to discuss this further or explore other possibilities with a human agent, I can transfer you. Please let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed.",

According to our policy, while Basic Economy flights cannot be modified in terms of changing the flights, you are allowed to upgrade the cabin class to Economy or Business for all flights in the reservation, provided none of the flights have been flown yet. Upgrading the cabin class for your current reservation is possible since your flights are scheduled for May 21, 2024, and haven't been flown.\n\nIf you choose to upgrade to Economy, the price per passenger for the nonstop flight HAT041 on May 21 is $136. Since you have 3 passengers in your reservation, this would be the new cost per passenger. If the total price after the upgrade is higher than the original, you will need to pay the difference. If it's lower, you will be refunded the difference.\n\nHere are the details of the action I can take:\n- Upgrade the cabin class of reservation OWZ4XL from Basic Economy to Economy for all passengers.\n- Keep the current flights or change to the nonstop flight HAT041 if the upgrade allows for such flexibility under policy terms (noting that flight changes are generally not permitted for Basic Economy even with an upgrade, but I will confirm).\n\nHowever, I must clarify that even with an upgrade, changing the flight itinerary (to a nonstop flight) is not permitted for Basic Economy reservations under our policy. Upgrading the cabin class does not alter the restriction on flight modifications. Therefore, I can assist with upgrading your cabin class, but I cannot change your flights to the nonstop option.\n\nWould you like to proceed with upgrading the cabin class to Economy for your current reservation?
